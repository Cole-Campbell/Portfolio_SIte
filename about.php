					<p>I am a Multimedia Designer with an eye for design and an aptitude for coding. I recently graduated from the Limerick Institute of Technology with my Bachelor of Science (Honours) Degree in Creative Multimedia. I also obtained my Advanced Diploma in Multimedia Design from Durham College in 2014.</p>
					<p>Most recently, I completed a wonderful placement with Ireland Chauffeur Travel in Cashel as a Multimedia Specialist. Before I pursued my Honours Degree I worked for Iconic Group in Toronto as a Web Admin Specialist. Through my academic career, I pursued the opportunity to work in the Centre for Academic Faculty Enrichment as a Multimedia Assistant to further refine my skills.</p>
					<p>During my free time I create new personal projects to build my portfolio and further build upon and refine my skills, learn new development languages (I am currently learning Ruby and Rails), keep my eyes open for inspiration through social media and everyday things, and I can be found doing all of these things with a coffee or tea at the ready.</p>
